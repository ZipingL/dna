# My DNA

This is another one of those github static pages. Okay I will stop doing static pages now and go back to finishing liu.academy and its research report for Append C.

Because some companies still find it proper and wise, no it's not the company, my apologies:
 - Specific Person(s) within a corporation that have become a virus that infected the organizational processes
Such persons still think it wise to not take accoutnability and make prudent actions with full corrrespondance.
 - I am just right now, speechless and very disappointed in whatever ability these people think they had.
 - They never had any. If you need to retaliate to get what you want in life, then you are pretty much someone who admitted to complete failure.
 - Because like [#TheDropout](https://www.hulu.com/series/the-dropout-13988f84-f1c8-40dd-a73c-4e71ab4bbe63), you become something that simply is a leach, because you rather think it wise to believe the value is from a paper saying you have a major corp or some number in your phone that says you have a high score
   - Than, to actually embody the high score as simply the outcome of who you are. And you become a recurively negative-delta blackhole of failure.
   - Liu LLC approves the #TheDropout as a fully realistic artistic portrayal of this so-called "tech" industry if just simpeltons like Andy Jassy lensla Adam Selipsky et al, with their Attorney Drones of Yes Mans.
